1. **How does it work?**
    - "Boy or Girl?" uses an Artificial Intelligence algorithm to take in a name and output whether the name is a boy's name or a girl's name.
    - The algorithm has learnt how to make these output predictions by learning from over 35,000 English first names.
2. **Does it work for non-English names?**
    - The algorithm was developed by feeding it English names and hence has the highest accuracy on English names. However, I did notice decent accuracy on Indian names since they share the same root language in the past. The accuracy seems to be bad on Chinese or non-English sounding names.
3. **Do you store my information?**
    - NO! The algorithm runs on the names your provide and plots out the ouput predictions. The names are lost after that and the app does not store any information
